## Composite order defaults to outer frustum as top layer.

### Issue 
When running renderstream, if assigning the outer frustum to a different camera in disguise, it appears for some reason to always take precedent regardless of the composite order.

### Workaround
Create serpate RS layers for inner and outer frustum, place the outer layer below the inner layer and assign different RXs to each.
