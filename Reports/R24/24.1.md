## Crash to desktop on vx4 and vx4+

### Issue 
There is a disguise advisory TA-39 tha reports an issue with gpu fan speed setting by disguise that can cause a crash of the software.

### Workaround
Update to 4.1.1

## Installing 4.1 corrupts AMD driver

### Issue
When installing and running 4.1 it causes a non-recoverable crash that permanently bricks the AMD driver. You will notice this as on startup without running disguise the machine will default to a lower gui resolution and the menu item for the AMD Radeon control panel no longer populates. If you try to run it from the windows task menu it will say no driver is found.

### Workaround
Unfortunately, the options are not great. You either need to run a redisguise and then update to 24.1.1, or install the latest AMD radeon pro driver. The one packaged with disguise 22.Q1 does not seem available for download. Only 23.Q1 or 21.Q1.
