## Disguise only request half the max frame rate of the project.

### Issue 
When running even a basic test renderstream workload, disguise only sends 31 requests if you are running at 60fps. This cap seems to be hard limited by some variable set in the software.

### Workaround
None currently at the moment.

## Disguise freezes when clicking the details button on a running RX.

### Issue
When running a workload and attempt to click the details button to see the log from an RX the program will hang, sometimes briefly, sometimes permanently.

### Workaround
None currently at the moment.

## VX4+ looses 10bit or is unable to be configured to be 10bit.

### Issue
Attempting to set the outputs to 10bit results in failures.

### Workaround
Unplug HDMIs from VFC cards, set vfc outputs to managed edid, apply feed settings, wait. Once they are green, reconnect HDMIs and set them to unmanaged.
To get framelock back, open the amd control panel, select FL/GL settings and manually reconfigure genlock and framelock.
