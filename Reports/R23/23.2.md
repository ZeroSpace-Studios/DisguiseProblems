## Color calibration keeps appending to LUTs.

### Issue 
When doing a color calibration in an MR set, the LUTs keep appending to the LUTs already in the set. This is not the expected behavior. There is no explicit option to overwrite the LUTs in the set. 

### Workaround
Delete the LUTs from file explorer in internal/luts before doing a color calibration.


## Color calibration pre-calbration drops a frame.

### Issue
When doing a color calibration in an MR set, the pre-calibration drops a frame causing it to not continue and give an error, or it will only do a few colors and succeed. 

### Workaround
You have to keep clicking the capture button until it finally captures.


## Virtual Lineup Layers cause significant frame drops.

### Issue
When using virtual lineup layers, the GPU time spikes msssively on the director. This has been an ongoing issue that started in R21.

### Workaround
Disable the virtual lineup layers between taking spatial calibrations. This will cause the GPU time to drop back down to normal levels.

## 10 bit color does not apply to actors.

### Issue
When using 10 bit color, the actors do not apply the 10 bit color.

### Workaround
Go into the nvidia control panel on each actor and change the colorspace from system to Nvidia, set the color space to YCbCr 4:2:2, and set the bit depth to 10 bit, then hit apply. This will allow the actors to apply the 10 bit color.

## %s incorrect format for datetime.

### Issue
Strange error appears in the notifications window after doing a spatial calibration. Seems to be a printf or sprintf date formatting error that causes the problem.

### Workaround
None.

## Actors take time to replicate parameters.

### Issue
When adding media or changing parameters on the director, it takes a few seconds for the actors to replicate the changes. Seems to be most effected in video layers.
