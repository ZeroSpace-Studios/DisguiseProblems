# Disguise Issues

Documenting issues found within the Disguise Media Server Software and their possible workarounds. This is a community effort, so please feel free to contribute.

## Structure

Each folder contains a `README.md` file that describes the issues. Each file is named after the minor version release, and each folder is the major version. For example, `1.0.0` is the first release of Disguise Media Server 1.0. We will be starting with version R23.

Use the following template to add issues to the repo:

```markdown
## Issue Title
